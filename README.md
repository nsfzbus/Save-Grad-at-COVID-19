# Save-Grad-at-COVID-19

+ This is a project relating to every graduate in the US at this special time. Although courses have already been suspended in many universities, many graduate students are still required to work in campus (especially for experimental groups that cannot work from home), which might be dangerous to their health. We want to record how the **Research Works** would go. Is it stopped, turned online, or kept going as normal?
+ If you are sure (or 90% sure) about the policies or decisions in your group, department or school, please help update it here.
